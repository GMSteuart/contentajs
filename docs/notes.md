#### Notes
_This is a dumping ground of notes. This section will disappear eventually, it's
just meant to save ideas for documentation to process some other time._

- Mention that both Drupal and node need to talk to the same Redis server.
- Make it clear that this is a starting point. To this node install you can:
  proxy to other microservices, add server side rendering, etc.
- Server side rendering can be added as a package / middleware.
