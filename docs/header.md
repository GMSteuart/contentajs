**IMPORTANT:** this project is meant to be a starting kit for the node
integration of your application based on Contenta CMS. We **do not** provide
upgrade paths or backwards compatibility. The model for this is _Fork & Go_. If
you have an existing application and want to include some new features to your
to it based on this repo's latest updates you will have to do it yourself.
However this repo will help you figure out the necessary details for it.
